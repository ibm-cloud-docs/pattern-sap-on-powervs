# Migration design
{: #migration-design}

There are several migration scenarios, but the most straight-forward is a
direct "lift-and-shift" (homogeneous) where the Infrastructure and SAP
versions remain the same. For example, on-premises SAP NetWeaver ABAP 7.0
running on VMWare to the same environment on cloud. Migration from
on-premises to another infrastructure platform or SAP version
(heterogeneous) can become more complex, especially when combined with a
DB conversion or application server upgrade.

For a list of migration options and tools, see [Moving SAP Workloads](/docs/sap?topic=sap-faq-moving-sap-workloads#faq-moving-sap-workloads-overview).

There are two types of SAP migration categories:

Homogeneous
:    Target has the same OS and software versions as the source

Heterogeneous
:    Target has a different OS, software, or database type or
version than the source

The following tables summarize various approaches for a homogeneous and
heterogeneous migration; all dependent on client environments and
preferences.
