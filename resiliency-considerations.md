# Resiliency design
{: #resiliency-design}

Resiliency is the ability of a workload to meet a specific target
Service Level Objective (SLO), Service Level Availability (SLA) or
recover from a service disruption and still meet the required SLA.
Resiliency needs to be considered at both the infrastructure and
application layers across the entire solution.

A resilient design might include Disaster Recovery (DR) and High
Availability (HA) depending on SLA requirements and they are two
different things.

Disaster Recovery is the infrastructure, application layers, and
accompanying set of policies and procedures to enable the recovery or
continuation of vital technology infrastructure and applications
following a natural or human-induced disaster.

High Availability is the resource availability in a solution throughout
the stack, built in by design, to withstand individual component
failures in the system.

Both DR and HA can be enabled by using several technologies and approaches that depend on the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time
Objective (RTO) and SLA requirements.

The following table shows a comparison of the different deployment options.

1. Based on Cloud infrastructure
   [SLA](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=i126-9268&lc=en#detail-document){: external}
    Does not represent application availability

2. 3 or more instances in separate Availability Zones

SAP does not support the application layer and database to be deployed across different zones. The application and database layers must exist in the same availability zone or COLO. Therefore, the highest availability that can be supported is 99.95%.

For more information on Resiliency on IBM Cloud, see [High Availability and Resiliency on IBM Cloud](/docs/ha-infrastructure?topic=ha-infrastructure-landing-about-ha-dr-backup).

Depending on requirements and design, an SAP deployment on IBM cloud can
support 99.95% availability. Unfortunately, SAP does not certify
solutions that span multiple zones, so resiliency is deployed to a
single zone with multiple server instances in the same zone.

The IBM Cloud application load balancer along with SAP Web Dispatcher
spreads client requests or loads across 2 or more server instances for
improved resiliency and improved performance. In addition, IBM Cloud
load balancers do health checks to make sure that only healthy virtual
server instances receive client requests.

IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers are designed by hardened configuration
within a single data center to provide 99.95% SLA. For more details, refer
to [Service Level Agreements for IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=i126-9268&lc=en#detail-document){: external}.

To increase availability for SAP systems on IBM Power Systems Virtual
servers, High Availability instances can be deployed within the same
data center with "Different Server" [placement
group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-placement-groups),
and Disaster Recovery systems can be deployed in a different region.

To maximize investment on DR infrastructure so DR infrastructure is not
idle, it's recommended to have cross-region passive DR deployed on
reduced-size VMs. To reserve the capacity for DR systems, a [Shared Processor Pool](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/power9?topic=systems-managing-shared-processor-pools){: external}
can be setup with a small fee.

Alternative cost optimized DR systems can be configured so that DR
systems share infrastructure with Non-Production systems, if
segmentation/compliance/licensing/Non-Production system availability and
other client requirements allow.

The IBM Cloud environment does not support any preconfigured
high-availability (HA) scenarios for SAP. However, HA scenarios can be
configured based on the HA extension for the operating system. HA
extensions are created by adding the required hardware and the required
software components to SAP landscapes.

For example, see [Network layout for Scale-out configurations](/docs/sap?topic=sap-refarch-hana-scaleout#network-layout-for-scale-out-configurations-2)
for an overview of a single-zone resilient SAP Scale-out deployment.

A combination of SAP Native Database Backup tools is used to deliver the
resiliency services such as:

- DBACOCKPIT

- HANACOCKPIT

- Backint for SAP Database backups

To support database recovery for points in time going back at least one
month, a daily database backup is required, along with redo log backups
every 15 minutes.

- For long-term recovery of data, an additional monthly backup is suggested with a one-year data retention or as determined by the customer.

- The daily log backup frequency for production DB should be less than or equal to the customer wanted RPO parameter for their Business Continuity Plan.

- Production System Monthly full retained for 60 days. Daily Full retained for 1 week. Daily incremental retained for 60 days. Weekly Full retained for 30 days.

- Non-Productions System Monthly full retained for 60 days. Weekly Full retained for 14 days. Daily incremental retained for 60 days.

Consider the largest DB size for full backups with room for addition
growth. Recommend complementing the backup solution with daily snapshots
for production.
